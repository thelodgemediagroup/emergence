If you want to skip all this and just get your site working, you should be able to get by with changing a couple of the options on the Miscellaneous tab, and you are in business. The rest of these settings exist to give you the option of customizing your website to whatever level you want. Some of the tabs are further categorized by toggle bars for your convenience. Just click the toggle bar title to expand the section and manage the options, and click it again to collapse it. The options are layed out in an intuitive, easy-to-use format that makes it easy for you to find the setting you want to adjust. There is a short description next to each option, so if something seems confusing at first, just look at the description and you will probably figure it out. If at any time you do get stuck and cannot figure out how to make Continuum do what you want it to do, you have four options at your disposal:"

Keep in mind, this tab deals with the layout of the elements specific to the front page. If you are wondering where things like background, logo, ad placement, \"feed\" layout, and \"breaking\" slider settings are, you will find those on other tabs, such as the Ads tab or the Miscellaneous tab, since these are elements that appear on more pages than just the front page."

It is a way of presenting as much of your content as you can to your readers in an attempt to get them to stay on your site as long possible, viewing as many pages as possible. Because there are different kinds of pages in Wordpress - the front page, blog pages, regular pages, archive pages, etc. - there are slightly different settings for each kind of page."
